                What is the file security?

                File security is protecting files from any unauthorized access,illegal tampering,deletion ,damage,and degradation. It used on documents that contain sensitive personal information, business information, and even state secrets. The files come in different forms, such as audio,video, and databases files. It ensures that sensitive data remains confidential, and only the authorized users can access it and find it.
                
                
                How it works?
                
                Access control mechanisms 
                
                Access control mechanisms categories who can read, modify or delete files. This role-based access (RBAC), discretionary access control (DAC), and mandatory access control (MAC), which tells you about users permissions based on predefined policies.
                
                
                
                
                
                Encryption:
                
                Encryption secures files it converts them into unreadable formats unless the authorized user can decrypts files. This protects data from being stolen or accessed by unauthorized users.
                
                
                File integrity monitoring 
                
                File integrity monitoring (FIM) it detects any changes to files that occur by unauthorized persons. It continuously scans for any modifications and send alerts to administrators if there is suspicious activities are detected.
                
                
                Backup and recovery 
                
                Regular backup ensure the data can be restored in case of accidental deletion,corruption,or any malware attack.it the important strategy to protect your from being stolen or destroyed by the system.
                
                Benefits of file security 
                
                Data confidentiality: it protects data from any unauthorized access to sensitive files.
                
                Regulatory compliance: ensuring follows to legal requirements like GDPR,HIPAA,and PCI-DSS.
                
                Business continuity: protect files from data loss and ensure files functioning properly.
                
                
                Challenges:
                
                
                1.	User access mismanagement
                
                If the administration does not have the skills to organize file access to assigned users in the machines it can lead to various problems for organizations that some sensitive data will be leaks to an untheorized people.
                
                2.	Encryption key Management 
                
                Encryption keys are the most important thing you should protect against untheorized people, and if you are losing the keys it can lead to permanently losing data in your device. The encryption key is the save way to protect data from leaks to illegal people.
                
                3.	Performance overhead 
                
                The administrators implement high level of security rules and algorithms to improve the files security, and cannot any person read or write unless have the permission to do so. Security rules can impact the device performance it may not always apply the security rules because of high pressure on the device.
                
                 
                4.	Compliance complexity 
                
                The organization faced significant challenges in adherence to multitude of security regulations. 
                
                The organization is forced to follow security regulations to be a legal company, and to have a chance to cooperate with government. some organizations face challenges to apply all regulation that country assigned to all companies in her region.
                
                
                
                
                
                Conclusion 
                
                File security is main for protecting important data from illegal personal,loss,encryption, integrity monitoring,and backup solutions improve the cybersecurity framework. Organization must balance security rules with usability to ensure efficient and secure data management.
