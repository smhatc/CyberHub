                        <h2 class="blog-subheading">What are Firewalls and Network Access Controls?</h2>
                        <p class="blog-para">A firewall is a type of network security device that uses established security rules to track and control all network traffic, inflow and outgoing. Between dependable internal networks and unreliable external networks (such as the internet), it acts like a barrier.</p>
                        <p class="blog-para">Network Access Controls (NAC) is a similar concept which revolves around the idea of being a security solution that provides rules to devices that have access to a network. It enhances overall network security by limiting access to the network to only authorized and compliant devices.</p>
                        <h2 class="blog-subheading">How It Works</h2>
                        <h3 class="blog-subheading">Firewalls</h3>
                        <p class="blog-para">Using security rules, firewalls examine data packets and decide whether to permit or prohibit them.
                        Firewalls come in a variety of forms, such as application-layer firewalls, stateful inspection firewalls, and packet-filtering firewalls.</p>
                        <p class="blog-para">Furthermore, for helping administrators in keeping an eye on network security, firewalls commonly log traffic and send out alerts for suspicious activity.</p>

                                <li class="blog-list-item"><span class="blog-list-item-bold">Compliance Checks:</span> Before allowing access, NAC can verify that security standards (such as antivirus software and updates) are being followed.</li>

                        <ul class="blog-list">
                                <li class="blog-list-item"><span class="blog-list-item-bold">Complex Implementation:</span> Integrating NAC with current security systems might be necessary and setting it up can be challenging.</li>

                        <h2 class="blog-subheading">Conclusion & Recommendations</h2>
                        <p class="blog-para">A strong network security plan should involve both firewalls and network access controls. While NAC makes sure that only devices that comply can connect, firewalls protect networks from threats and illegal access. Although these technologies improve security, they also present challenges that call for cautious preparation and handling. Organizations can greatly enhance their overall security posture by adopting these solutions.</p>
