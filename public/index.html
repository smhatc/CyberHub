                        <p class="home-csinfo-para">Good question. In todayâ€™s day and ageâ€”with everything becoming digitizedâ€”itâ€™s easy to forget the fundamentals founding the technology-driven world we live in. Yet, it is precisely those very fundamentals that drive the ever-increasing trust we place in our technology to keep our personal, professional, and financial lives safe and secure on the internet. This is where cybersecurity comes in.</p>
                        <p class="home-csinfo-para">At Cyber Hub, we believe that everyone, not just the privileged few, should have a basic level of understanding concerning the technology they are forced to rely on and how it keeps their data safe and sound. Furthermore, by spreading knowledge about these fundamental elements of the modern IT infrastructure, we aim to empower individuals interested in an IT or cybersecurity career with the knowledge necessary to get started in the field.</p>
                        <p class="home-csinfo-para">We currently have published several educational articles concerning fundamental cybersecurity topics such as <a href="library/cryptography.html">Cryptography</a>, <a href="library/networking.html">Networking</a>, and <a href="library/os.html">Operating Systems</a> with plans to expand our <a href="library.html">Library</a> in the future.</p>
